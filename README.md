This project presents the implementation of a simple neural network using HighLevel Synthesis (HLS) targeting an FPGA. The network consists of two dense
layers with ReLU and softmax activations. The design achieved efficient performance by leveraging hardware parallelism and custom approximations for mathematical functions.
